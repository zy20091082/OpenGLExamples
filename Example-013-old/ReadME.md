<H3>The <i>'Example-013 (Old Mode)'</i> Test</H3>

The <i>'Example-013 (Old Mode)'</i> Test draws several versions of the <i>'Square Annulus'</i> shape, in an <A href="http://www.opengl.org"><i>OpenGL</i></A> window. Recall that any <i>'Square Annulus'</i> shape is contained between 2 concentric axis-parallel rectangles of different size. The larger rectangle is called the <i>'external (larger)'</i> rectangle, instead other rectangle is called the <i>'internal (smaller)'</i> rectangle.<p>Here, the <i>'Square Annulus'</i> shape of interest is approximated by an unique triangle strip (in <i>'turquoise gray'</i>). The settings for rendering all triangles in the triangle strip of interest can be modified interactively by the user as follows:<p><ul>
<li>only the <i>'front'</i> sides of all triangles in the triangle strip of interest are rendered by pressing the <i>'f'</i> or the <i>'F'</i> key. The corresponding rendering type is chosen by the user separately.<p></li>
<li>Only the <i>'back'</i> sides of all triangles in the triangle strip of interest are rendered by pressing the <i>'b'</i> or the <i>'B'</i> key. The corresponding rendering type is chosen by the user separately.<p></li>
<li>Both the <i>'front'</i> and the <i>'back'</i> sides of all triangles in the triangle strip of interest are rendered by pressing the <i>'t'</i> or the <i>'T'</i> key. The corresponding rendering type is chosen by the user separately.<p></li>
<li>Only the vertices for the sides of all triangles in the triangle strip to be drawn are rendered by pressing the <i>'p'</i> or the <i>'P'</i> key. The user can choose separately what sides of all triangles must be drawn.<p></li>
<li>The <i>'wireframe versions'</i> for the sides of all triangles in the triangle strip to be drawn are rendered by pressing the <i>'l'</i> or the <i>'L'</i> key. The user can choose separately what sides of all triangles must be drawn.<p></li>
<li>The <i>'filled versions'</i> for the sides of all triangles in the triangle strip to be drawn are rendered by pressing the <i>'i'</i> or the <i>'I'</i> key. The user can choose separately what sides of all triangles must be drawn.<p></li></ul><p>Likewise, the window of interest can be closed by pressing any among the <i>'Q'</i>, the <i>'q'</i>, and the <i>'Esc'</i> keys.<p><table border=0 width=100%><tr>

<td>In this case, the <i>'front'</i> sides of all triangles are not rendered, due to their vertices order. In the code, these latters are enumerated in the clockwise order, thus every triangle is a back-faced triangle.<p>

Hence, the scene remains unchanged, when the user decides to render only the <i>'front'</i> sides of all triangles in the triangle strip.<p>This is true, even if changing the rendering type for all triangles (points, wireframe, filled).</td>

<h4>Dependencies</h4>

The <i>'Example-013 (Old Mode)'</i> Test is based on the so-called <i>OpenGL old (direct drawing) mode</i>, and requires the following dependencies:<ul>

<li>the <A href="http://www.opengl.org"><i>OpenGL</i></A> package, distributed with the platform of interest (see the <i><A href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Getting_Started">Official Documentation</A></i>);</li>
<li>the <i><A href="https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/">OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT)</A></i> package (or the <A href="http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/"><i>FreeGLUT</i></A> package);</li>
<li>the <A href="http://glew.sourceforge.net/"><i>OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW)</i></A> package.</li></ul><p>In particular, this test consists of the <i>'Example-013-old'</i> executable file (directly in the <i><code>'bin'</code></i> folder, or in a specific subfolder of the <i><code>'bin'</code></i> folder), starting uniquely from the <i>'main.cpp'</i> C++ source file (in the <i><code>'src'</code></i> folder).<p>Several methods for building this test are provided, and their building infrastructure is saved in the following folders:<p><ul>
<li>the <i><code>'cmake'</code></i> folder contains the project file for the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i>;</li>
<li>the <i><code>'vstudio'</code></i> folder contains the solution file for the <i><A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</A></i>;</li>
<li>the <i><code>'xcode'</code></i> folder contains the project file for the <i><A href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Apple XCode</A></i>.</li></ul><br><table border=1><tr><td><p><b>ATTENTION:</b><p>The majority of the dependencies for this test are stable, but are currently deprecated, and several warning messages may appear during the building process.<p></td></tr></table><p><hr><p>

<h4>Instructions for building this test with the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i></h4>

This test is built by using the <i>classic</i> instructions for building a program with the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i> from the <i><code>'cmake\'</code></i> folder:
<pre>mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
</pre><p>As mentioned above, the <i>'Example-013-old'</i> executable file is saved in (a specific subfolder of) the <i><code>'bin'</code></i> folder. For instance, this test is executed by running:<pre>./bin/Example-013-old</pre><p>This building method is tested with the <A href="http://gcc.gnu.org/"><i>GCC</i></A> under the Ubuntu Linux 16.0.4 (LTS), as well as with the <A href="http://clang.llvm.org/"><i>CLANG</i></A> compiler under the MacOsX 11.* El-Capitan (and higher), and the <A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/"><i>Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</i></A> under the Microsoft Windows 10.<p>In this latter case, three custom projects are automatically generated, and ready to be open in the <A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/"><i>Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</i></A>. The solution file of interest is the <i>'Example-013-old.sln'</i> solution file, which can be exploited without being modified. This test is built by clicking on the <i>'Build'</i> command. The resulting <i>'Example-013-old.exe'</i> executable file is stored in the <i><code>'bin\Debug'</code></i> folder, if the debugging symbols are included, or in the <i><code>'bin\Release'</code></i> folder, otherwise.<p>

All dependencies of the <i>'Example-013 (Old Mode)'</i> Test are supported automatically by the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i> through a built-in manifest file. In particular, they are often pre-installed in a generic GNU/Linux distribution, and distributed in conjunction with the <A href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/"><i>Apple XCode</i></A>. Thus, they should be found by the script of interest without problems in these platforms.<p>Instead, these libraries are not standard in the Microsoft Windows, and must be installed properly. For the sake of simplicity, the Win32 versions for the auxiliary libraries of interest in the <i><code>'depends'</code></i> folder are exploited, if the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i> fails while performing their automatic identification. This means that the resulting solution file creates automatically the Win32 version of the <i>'Example-013-old.exe'</i> executable file.<p>An interested user finds more details about other possible customization options in the Official Documentation of the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i>.<p><hr><p>

<h4>Instructions for building this test with the <i><A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</A></i></h4>

This test is also built by using the <A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/"><i>Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</i></A>. In particular, the <i><code>'vstudio\'</code></i> folder contains the <i>'Example-013-old.sln'</i> solution file, which can be exploited without being modified. This test is built by clicking on the <i>'Build'</i> command. The resulting <i>'Example-013-old.exe'</i> executable file is stored in the <i><code>'Debug'</code></i> folder, if the debugging symbols are included, or in the <i><code>'Release'</code></i> folder, otherwise.

Note that this solution file is independently created from scratch, and is different from the solution file, which may be generated automatically by the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i>.

Specifically, the Win32 versions for the auxiliary libraries of interest in the <i><code>'depends\'</code></i> folder are exploited for building the <i>'Example-013 (Old Mode)'</i> Test. This implies that the <i>'Example-013-old.sln'</i> solution file is set up for including these auxiliary libraries, and it should not be modified, unless you are an expert. Furthermore, it is mandatory to enable the building for a generic Win32 platform for creating correctly the Win32 version of the <i>'Example-013-old.exe'</i> executable file.<p>An interested user finds more details in the Official Documentation of the <i><A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</A></i>.<p><hr><p>

This test is also built by using the <A href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/"><i>Apple XCode</i></A> (based on the <A href="http://clang.llvm.org/"><i>CLANG</i> compiler</A>) under the MacOsX 11.* El-Capitan (and higher). In particular, the <i><code>'xcode'</code></i> folder contains the <i>'Example-013-old.xcodeproj'</i> project file, which can be exploited without being modified. This test is built by clicking on the <i>'Build & Run'</i> command. The resulting <i>'Example-013-old'</i> executable file is stored in the <i><code>'Build/Products/Debug/'</code></i> folder, if the debugging symbols are included, or in the <i><code>'Build/Products/Release/'</code></i> folder, otherwise.<p>

Note that this project file is independently created from scratch, and is different from the project file, which may be generated automatically by the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i>.<p>

Specifically, this project file includes the versions (frameworks) of the <A href="http://www.opengl.org"><i>OpenGL</i></A> and of the <i><A href="https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/">OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT)</A></i> packages, that are distributed in conjunction with the <A href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/"><i>Apple XCode</i></A>. Instead, the headers and the library files of the <A href="http://glew.sourceforge.net/"><i>OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW)</i></A> are assumed to be stored in the <i><code>'/usr/local/include/'</code></i> and the <i><code>'/usr/local/lib/'</code></i> folders, respectively.
